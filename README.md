PHP-Sample-Table
================

This demo simply displays a table from a database, demonstrating use of some object-oriented functionality and connection to the database.

To run the demo, create the database objects found in database objects.txt and alter username, password, and hostname in config.php.  (These are stored in plain text to facilitate the example.)
